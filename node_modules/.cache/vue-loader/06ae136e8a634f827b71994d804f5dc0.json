We want to open up conversations about emotion recognition systems: from the science behind the technology to their social impacts--and everything else in between. Our aim is to promote public understanding of these technologies and citizen involvement in their development and use. </p>\n        <p>We are interested in gathering information about people’s experiences of emotion recognition systems and your thoughts on their practical applications in order to further people-centred learning on the topic. This is a participatory knowledge-building exercise -- your perspective matters, and we want to hear your experiences, reflections, reactions and concerns. </p>\n        <p>Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you want to discuss these topics with us in more detail.
